### Nauvis TODO
1. Behavioral
    1. ~~Make an anouncement when the first mineshaft is build on a surface or last is destroyed so that   the player knows which surfaces are available~~
    1. ~~Fix underground belts facing the backwards direction~~
    1. ~~Limit mineshafts to land surfaces (no space platforms)~~
    1. ~~Make subterranean science packs only craftable underground~~
    1. ~~Fix solar system map icons/buttons and remote view~~
    1. ~~Lock mineshaft belt types behind their base belt types~~
    1. ~~Fix orderings on all new items~~
    1. ~~Make diamond-tipped crushers for space platforms~~
    1. ~~Add subterranean pipes~~
    1. ~~Add a pump to the mineshaft pipe recipe~~
    1. ~~Make the mineshaft belts a bit more expensive~~
    1. ~~Make cliff destroyers drop off some resources after they visit a port~~ - Not doing because cliff explosives don't make resources
    1. ~~Should the mineshaft be replaced with a planet-specific tech that unlocks drilling into the surface?~~
        1. ~~This would make it so that each planet could have a specific tech for the first level of subterranian and each subsequent 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc level~~
        1. ~~This would also get rid of the problem where a mineshaft can be destroyed and soft-lock a player out of moving between different subterranian layers. Assuming that if a player dies they respawn on the same surface, if not the player could die and respawn on a different surface where they maybe couldn't make a new set of armor~~
        1. ~~Should the generic drill be an item that goes in the player's armor? A downside would be limiting the drill tech behind modular armor. Each new planet-specific tech would also not want to be a new item, just a new effect on the drill item. Considering the [module armor tech](https://wiki.factorio.com/Modular_armor_(research)) is only behind 100 red and green science this seems totally fine~~
