### Fulgora TODO
1. Behavioral
    1. Figure out how to make straight-line terrain up-down and left-right for the subway tunnels
        1. Could rails (or high-tech rails?) but added?
    1. Figure out how to spawn a preset-style room on a specific point
        1. These should have some sort of security door that the player has to destroy to enter and then they get swarmed by bugs
        1. Make these presets act as more of a dungeon-crawler where the player has to choose to expand, and fight a wave to continue
    1. Design Fulgoran Subway tech tree
    1. Design Fulgoran Subway enemy spawns
        1. Cyber-biters that were expirimented on and escaped, killing all the Fulgorans but were driven back underground by the lightning storms. Could these escape to the surface?
        1. Cyber-pentapods that are similar to the cyber biters
        1. Cyber-demolishers?
    1. Design advanced-scrap recycling loop similar to the fulgoran surface but with different recyclers to get different materials
        1. Should there be different scrap types?
        1. Should there be different scrapping buildings?
        1. Having different types and recyclers could make it so that there is a multiplicative number of outputs, which could be good or bad (might be too complex)
1. Graphics
    1. Design the flooring of the fulgoran subway
    1. Design the underground fulgoran lab buildings
