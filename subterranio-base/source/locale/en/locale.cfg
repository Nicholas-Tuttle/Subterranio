[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
subterranean-caves=Subterranean Caves can be accessed once a tunnelling drill have been equipped into personal armor. Use ctrl-enter (by default) to travel between the surface and underground. There is no sunlight underground so other means of power must be found. Mineshaft belts and pipes can be used to connect resources between the surface and the caverns. Mineshaft belts will go from the origin surface to the other surface, pipes are bi-directional.
